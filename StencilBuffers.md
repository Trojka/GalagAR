Stencil Buffers
===============

According to the Unity documentation (https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Stencil.html)

    The stencil buffer is usually an 8 bit integer per pixel. The value can be written to, increment or decremented. Subsequent draw calls can test against the value, to decide if a pixel should be discarded before running the pixel shader.
